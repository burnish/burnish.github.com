Apps don't marked themselves. I need to be able to explain how Casterly differs from other podcast apps, and how those differences can make for a better experience. Not really knowing where to start, I thought I'd just try to document the typical intro I'd give in person. It might be a bit dry compared to a proper product video, but you've got to walk before you can run.

### For the sake of completeness, let's start with the welcome tour (feel free to skip ahead).

<video><video/>

The main purpose of the welcome tour is to select a Twitter account, and link it with a Casterly account.
Following that, there are a few sentences describing how to use the app.
It is meant to take about 15 seconds, which should be enough time for the server to find some episodes from your Twitter stream.


### The main screen of the app presents a personalised episode stream.

<video></video>

It starts off as list episodes that have been mentioned in your Twitter stream.
Episodes also arrive in your stream through subscriptions, and there is a bookmarklet to add an episode. There is also obviously plenty of scope for recommendations beyound Twitter in the future.
Swiping an episode to the left, adds it to (or removes it from) the playlist. Episodes in the playist are marked with a star.
Swiping an episode to the right subscribes to (or unsubcribes from) future episodes.


### To the left of the main episode stream is the playlist.

<video></video>

That there is exactly one playlist is one of the key design desicions that differentiates Casterly from most other podcast apps.
You never need to choose between playlists.
The main visual difference between the playlist and the episode stream (other than its yellow colour), is that each episode has a reorder control. That is, the playlist is always in editing mode.


### On the right is a list the shows you are subscribed to, ordered by the date of their most recent episode. 

<video></video>

There are no unplayed counts on the shows.
You should feel free to subscribe to more than just the shows you intend to keep up to date with. 
Subscribing to a show just means that new episodes arrive in your stream.
If you have any favourite shows that you want to be sure not to miss, you can swipe them to the left to add a star.
Any new episodes of starred shows will be automatically added to your playlist.
You can swipe a show to the right to unsubscribe, which will remove it from the list.

### The episode screen itself is fairly simple.

<video></video>

There are basic playback controls play/pause, skip forward/backward, a volume slider, and a playback scrubber.
Tapping on the episode artwork reveals the same show screen that you would see if you tapped on a show.
The scrubber is designed to behave mostly like a standard iOS slider, but with a small tweak to allow precise control in a playful way.

### A few more bits.

<video></video>

The headphone icon in the top right is a "now playing" button which doubles as a "play now" button, for when nothing is currently playing.
By default episodes in your playlist are automatically downloaded in the background. In a perfect world you wouldn't really need to worry about what was going on. But for when you do, there's a screen for managing downloads.
The playback settings are fairly basic for for now. More options are planned for version 1.0.
