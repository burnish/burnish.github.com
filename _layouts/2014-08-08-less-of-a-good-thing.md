Deciding what features to include in a 1.0 is always hard. For [Casterly][casterly], one rule of thumb has been to leave out any feature I wouldn't use myself. For that reason, I've been happy omitting variable playback speed. But then the long awaited [Overcast][overcast] shipped, with "Smart Speed".

Obviously, it's a much loved feature. I can only commend Marco for its implementation. To my ears, it works as advertised. Shortening episodes by cutting out slices of silence so small that you don't notice the difference. But I just can't see myself using it.

Listening should be a pleasure. Why shorten the experience?
It would be one thing to shorten an episode if listening was a chore, but in that case, why not find a better show?

Perhaps it's easy to write this off as a contrarian opinon of a developer who's jealous of a killer feature. Never the less, I can't help mention it. Not to tell anyone they're doing it wrong by trying to squeeze extra shows into their limited listening time, but to better understand whether that's a problem I should be trying to solve with my app.
