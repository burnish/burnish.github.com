description: Introducing Burnish
---

For too many years I've been dreaming/talking about going out on my own to make software. Today is not that day. I'm not quitting my day job.

Burnish is somewhere for me to hang my hat. Maybe next time I get to that point where a side project is half finished, and inspiration is flagging, having a place to put it out in the open will get me over the line. We'll see.

I intend to write a few things here too. It's not something I'm normally inclined to do, but I want to be able to write clearly about my software, which takes practice.
