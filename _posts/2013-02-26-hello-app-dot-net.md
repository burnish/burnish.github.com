description: Why a free tier makes App.net worthwhile, and a brush with fate on the bus finding an invite.
---

App.net [went freemium][adn_announcement] today.
I'm not convinced I want it to succeed in Twitter's place (a [de-centralised][tent] alternative would be nice), but this is surely a step in the right direction.

Lack of a free tier had been the main barrier to my entry: I'm not averse to paying for the service, but I would cringe at encouraging a friend to join, obliging them to pay.

And what's the point of a social network you don't want to invite your friends to?

### But how does one obtain an invite?

I didn't personally know anyone using App.net. On the bus to work I thought I may as well search Twitter. As expected, there were many more posts asking for random invites than there were handing them out.

The most recent public offer was [three minutes old][invite_offer], I checked out the poster's profile, and it turns out he's the creator of an app I love &ndash; [Screenshot Journal][screenshot_journal]!

Perfect, two birds with one stone. Ask for an invite, and thank him for his lovely app. By the time I hit post he was already fending off other randoms.

After some back and forth, and one code promptly gobbled up by some other lucky seeker, we sorted out a DM and I was in. Then into the bargain, we started a game of Letterpress!

All in all, a nice brush with fate. I look forward to my next bus trip.
