description: Why headphones might be Apple's first step in wearables.
---

There's a wacky theory I've previously reserved for conversation with some of my nerdier friends. After listening to the Internet talk about the Apple's possible acquisition of Beats for weeks, it's pained me not to hear it mentioned nearly enough [^1],[^2], [^3]. 

Bluetooth headphones today are in a similar position to MP3 Players in 2001, smart phones in 2006 and tablet PCs in 2010. They're a technology that 'believers' know can be transformative, but no one has quite cracked it. 

This has to be a large part of where Apple is looking for wearables.

### Small Potatoes

It's easy to write off headphones as a minor part of the experience. Often forgotten about in the bottom of the box. They're annoying. Cables get in the way and tangled up, then frayed and broken if you use them regularly.

All of that changes with a [good set][LG-tone] of wireless headphones. They're are a nice novelty if you use them occasionally, but after you use them regularly, to use anything else [becomes unthinkable][hypercritical-tomorrow]. 

### Transformative

I might be biased. As a frequent listener of podcasts, headphones are possibly the primary interface to my phone. But they truly change the way I use it. I could list a handful of examples, but the feature it boils down to is ability to instantly turn them off and divert my attention. No worry about some stupid cable dangling around my neck and where I'll put it.

It's at that point they become truly wearable.

### Wearable

There's a huge caveat to all of this. It's only of any use if people are willing to wear it. Maybe not all day, but for good chunks of it.

Tim Cook [pointed out two years ago][all-things-d] that he's not convinced many young people wear watches. Perhaps he's noticed that quite a few are very happy to wear a particular brand of headphones?

[^1]: In particular, [episode three of exponent.fm][exponent] goes in to great detail on the topic of Beats, the hosts are much wiser than me and had many good points, but it seems like a huge blind spot not to see how important headphones as wearables might be.

[^2]: In the latest episode of [Mobile couch][mobile-couch] Jake touches on it (about an hour in).

[^3]: Recent episodes of [atp.fm][ATP] have talked about this a fair bit. Many of the points that John Siracusa makes about the iPod shuffle hold true for a good set of headphones.
