I shipped [Casterly][casterly] this morning. I don't know whether it was ready, but I was. A couple of months ago I took an opportunity to book an inexpensive ad on a [podcast][new-disruptors] that exemplifies the spirit of making things. It aired today[^1], so I shipped version 0.6.3.

There are plenty of items still on the todo list. The version that ended up in the [app store][app-store] has an old icon, and the screen shots (which can't be changed) are out of date, sporting an orange colour that I decided had been well trodden by too many [other][instacast] [excellent][overcast] podcast apps.

But it's out the door, and it feels good. Forcing myself to ship has really changed my priorities, I think for the better.

Here's looking forward to 1.0.

[^1]: And I'm really happy with it, thanks Glenn!
