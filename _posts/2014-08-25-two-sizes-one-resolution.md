description: Further fruitless speculation about why different sized phones might share a resolution.

Following up yesterday's [post][speculation] speculating on possible future iPhone resolutions there was some back and forth on Twitter. I'm sure [@gruber][gruber] wasn't trying to say I was an [incompetent developer][incompetent] for thinking Apple might choose to simplify their product line by having two hypothetical devices share a resolution. Either way, it fired me up enough to write a bit more on the topic.

I don't expect to see two new resolutions if and when two new iPhone screen sizes are introduced.

  - A 5.5 inch display is 17% bigger than a 4.7 inch display. That compares with the iPad Air being 24% bigger than the iPad Mini, and they happily share pixel counts.
  - I don't anticipate all three sizes will share one resolution (a 5.5 inch display is 37% bigger than the current 4 inch, which is a bigger stretch).
  - I'm undecided whether a new 4.7 inch screen would share its resolution with the current 4 inch or a new 5.5 inch.

It's not about whether supporting multiple resolutions is [tough][tough] for developers and designers. Or whether Apple should cater to [incompetent developers][incompetent]. It doesn't matter how good of a developer or a designer you are, the fewer targets you have, the more attention you can pay to each target.

Ultimately, if Apple chooses to have three distinct iPhone resolutions[^2], it will come at some cost to the overall quality of apps that run on them.

As for [why Apple would bother][monkbent-why-two-sizes] making two screen sizes at the same resolution, there are obvious advantages.
  
  - Lots of content just looks better on a bigger physical display (photos and videos being the most obvious examples).
  - Fewer users will need to bump up the dynamic text size[^3].
  - Less need to zoom in[^1].
  - Retains the advantage of having a "pocketable" option for happy current iPhone owners.

[^1]: You have to wonder how much time is spent pinching and zooming around web views. Which would be much less necessary on a bigger phone, even with the same number of pixels.

[^2]: Four really, considering the 3.5 inch phone, but the difference there was only vertical, which tended to have much less impact.

[^3]: Or more importantly, many users who don't realise there is even the option to bump up the text size will be happier.
