description: Deciding between an iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus
---

There was no way I was going to choose between the 4.7 and 5.5 inch screen without holding them both in my hands. As an iPhone user, I was fairly confident that the smaller model would suit me better, but as a developer the larger screen would be better for testing.

After playing with them both side by side in the store for about 15 minutes, it was pretty clear that the normal iPhone 6 was the one for me.

### Big Hands

Seems slightly counter intuitive, but it was my big hands that made the decision to get the smaller phone easy.

The simple test I used for this was to just count how many apps on the home screen I could reach without contortion.

   - On the 4.7 inch screen there were no icons I couldn't reach. The top left and bottom left were a bit uncomfortable.
   - On the 5.5 inch screen there were 6 icons I couldn't reach without changing my grip, and another 6 that were uncomfortable.

Smaller hands would make the decision harder. If you're not able to use the phone one handed anyway, why not just get the bigger one?

### Crisp Screens

There's no doubt in my mind that the resolution scaling on the iPhone 6 Plus is noticeable. It's most obvious where there are one pixel lines, and you don't have to look very hard to find one pixel lines in iOS.

On the other hand, there are times when the higher resolution of the @3x display wins out, despite the scaling. An easy test is to observe the the second hand of the clock on the home screen as it rotates. To my eyes, the pixels are easily visible on a normal retina display almost the whole way around. On the @3x display I can only see the jaggies at a few angles.

It's a toss up for me as to whether I'd prefer @2x or scaled @3x. I certainly look forward to native @3x displays (and we'll see if @4x comes before my eyes degrade to the point where I can't tell the difference.)

### Huge Either Way

There's no denying it: these are big phones. I'll be very curious to try out swapping back to a 4 inch phone in a few months to see if I miss it.
