description: "Will the Apple Watch let me put some space between myself and my phone without becoming another device I need to put away?"
---

My two year old son Henry is at that stage where he can comfortably string a few words together, but when they come out as a properly formed sentence, it can take you a bit by surprise. He's got one down pat though: “Put your phone away!” It stings.

And he's right. Making a conscious effort to place my phone face down and out of reach, is a sure fire way for us to have a better time together. Sometimes though, that means I'll miss a call or message that I really shouldn't have.[^1] 

This is the problem I want Apple to solve for me with their watch. Let me put some distance between myself and my phone, but with confidence that I won't miss anything important. 

It’s just that ‘digital crown’ worries me. I don't want a device demanding enough of my attention that Henry might find me blankly staring at it: ‘Put your watch away!’

[^1]: This is not to say I want to be on alert all the time. Do Not Disturb is one of my favourite features. But sometimes knowing I'll be notified of anything important is the reason I can spend more time at home.
