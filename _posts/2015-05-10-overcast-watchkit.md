Credit to Marco Arment for the excellent job he's done updating the [Overcast WatchKit app][overcast]. Such a clear improvement over an initial version that "sucked" after two weeks with the device in hand is impressive. It's easy to imagine this becoming the expected behavior for podcast apps.

Most of my podcast listening is with apps of my own creation, but I do keep an eye/ear on a handful of others. The main interface of Overcast itself doesn't suit me very well, but there's no denying it's a carefully considered app.

The shows I listen to in other apps tend not to be my favourites. Overcast gets those that bore me, but somehow keep me abreast of the Apple echo chamber. Problem is, this nice watch app is making me want to put some of the shows I actually enjoy into Overcast. That would be no good for dog fooding. Time to get my act together and crack open WatchKit.
