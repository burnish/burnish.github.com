# A Very Pretty Junk Drawer

Ever since the introduction of the Apple Watch, I've been skeptical of the home screen and digital crown. Both seemed like tech demos that were too cool not to ship. Solutions in search of a problem. After wearing the watch for a month, I'm sold on the digital crown. It fits in seamlessly, and can be a delight to use. The home screen has not won me over. It is sometimes a delight to use, but adds [significant complexity][no-place-like-home] to the user interface as a whole. It took John Gruber eight weeks to get his head around the "[two modes][two-modes]".

At first, I thought I was being too negative. I love the watch, but the contrarian in me  always wants some nit to pick. As is often the case though, two recent podcasts have convinced me this is worth exploring. First was the always excellent [exponent.fm][exponent]. James Allworth [summed up most clearly][exponent-watch-that-does-stuff] the potential problem of thinking about the watch as a small phone[^1]. This is the home screen to a tee. Then on [The Talk Show][move-to-frisco], John Gruber referred to the app mode as a junk drawer[^2]. A junk drawer is a dangerous thing to have in the design of a piece of software, a pretty one is dangerous all the more. It's at least worth considering the opportunity cost of having this very pretty junk drawer.

As it stands there are four ways to launch an app. Horace Dediu lays them out in the this [heirarchy][battle-for-the-wrist]:
 - A complication 
 - A glance
 - A notification
 - The home screen

It's a problem that the last weighs so much on the overall complexity of the interface. A pragmatic solution would be to lessen the prominence of the app launcher (and stop calling it the "home screen"). Demote it from a mode (in Gruber's parlance) to an app whose sole purpose is to launch other apps. Of course, you need a way to launch it, one option would be the "null complication" (that is, a tap anywhere on the watch face that is not a complication).

But still, as a thought experiment, imagine how the watch might have been different if some authority at Apple had disliked the idea of a junk drawer enough to banish it.

Third party complications would be more of a necessity, and you would want complications for every first party app (perhaps with a way to choose which subset appear when customizing a face). The obvious counter to this point is that you can't fit enough complications on a watch face, but perhaps the absence of the launcher would allow more room for the interface to choose between faces. What if you could schedule faces for different times and places?

In my personal use, very few apps require me to resort to the launcher. It's not hard to imagine alternatives.
 - *Workouts:* I'd much prefer if I never needed to launch workouts at all, if the "continuous" heartrate monitoring worked well enough, I probably never would. That there is no path to launching it from the activity complication is infuriating.
 - *Camera Remote:* this screams out for some sort of handoff mode. (To outline a handoff mode UI is beyond the scope of this post, but a transient notification would be a good start.)
 - *Phone/Messages:* This is mostly a shortcoming of the "friends dial". Twelve contacts seems very limiting, why not force touch for a list of all contacts? (Or just for an option to launch the Phone and Messages apps.)

This is a short list, but I'm sure there would be other ways of launching apps that might be more suitable than a junk drawer. I can't help but wonder if its presence gets in the way of better options thriving.  

[^1]: Ben Thompson does most of the talking and makes many great points, but James really hits the nail on the head in a remark at about 53 minutes.
[^2]: To be fair, the exact words were "I almost think of the app mode as sort of like a junk drawer", and not meant in a denigrating way (1:09). Either way, the term "junk drawer" really crystalized my thoughts.
