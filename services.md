Most of our days are working on our own (upcoming) products.
But working for clients keeps us on our toes. No job too small. Get in touch.


### Mobile Applications

Mobile applications are often the most interesting to us. Burnish specialises in applications for iOS.

### Web Applications

Why not leverage the power of Google or Amazon?

### Web Sites

If all you need is a website, that's fine.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

Burnish makes software.

We are entirely capable at implementing visual design, and hold it in the highest regard,
but would recommend that you have someone more skilled at visual design to help you with your logos and branding.

We love to collaborate with great designers.

If you don't have a designer you're keen to engage with, we know some good ones.
